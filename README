if you hack without an IDE, as many minimalists do, you probably get visibility into your code by tailing logs.

have you ever thought "it would sure be nice if i could turn logging on and off for functional areas of my app easily"?

there are heavyweight solutions that do this.

..but thinlog does this in 1 class expressed in 18 lines of code.
thinlog is extremely lightweight.
thinlog is ridiculously easy to use.

if you hack without an IDE, as many minimalists do, you probably get visibility into your program's state by tailing logs.

enter thinlog.

thinlog only really has one feature:
  it lets you tag each log call with a tag name, and toggle logging for each tag


thinlog was designed to be extremely lightweight and is ridiculously easy to use.

ruby and python versions coming soon!

if you hack without an IDE, as many minimalists do, you probably get visibility into your code by tailing logs.

have you ever been in the middle of uncommenting a bunch of error_log calls,
  which you had just commnented out,
  before learning of a new bug in your feature?
  
ever thought "it would sure be nice if i could turn logging on and off for functional areas of my app easily"?

thinlog does this
thinlog is extremely lightweight
thinlog is ridiculously easy to use

if you hack without an IDE, as many minimalists do, you probably do so by tailing logs.

thinlog is extremely lightweight (~15 lines of code)

thinlog has a superb feature, called buckets



About Buckets

thinlog.php function calls can optionally be sent a bucket name as a second parameter

  This is useful if you want in-depth logging while developing a feature.  Just make your logging
      Once you're done developing it, you *could* delete all the thinlog calls...
      ...but that would be time-consuming
      ...and you may want those same log calls later, e.g. if you found a bug!
      Instead of deleting all the calls, you can just set the value of the bucket for that feature in question to 0!
      If you later run into bugs in that feature and wish to have visibility again, just set it back to 1!
